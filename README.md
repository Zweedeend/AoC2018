# Advent of Code 2018
This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2018 challenges in Python3

## How to run:
Each day has its own solution file:

```python
python day8.py
```

The input data is saved in the corresponing text file. E.g. `day8.py` reads its data from `day8.txt`

## How to test:
The tests are run using pytest:
```
pytest
```

## Python version
This code was written and tested on Python 3.9 but it has no dependencies and should work on all version of Python 3
